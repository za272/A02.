> Notes: Throughout these instructions replace `YourName`, `YourEmail`, `YourUsername`, and `A02` with your info. The remote repository name for this assignment should be `A02` (capital A matters).

### 1. Install software

2. Install WebStorm using the JetBrains installer for your OS. Sign into your JetBrains account if requested.  
3. (Optional) Install GitHub Desktop if you prefer a GUI client vs. command-line.

### 2. Configure **GIT** (one-time setup)
Open a terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and run:
```bash
git config --global user.name "YourName"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
